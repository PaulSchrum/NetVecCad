Note. I currently consider this module to be non-viable, so I do not expect to work on it any more and I will probably delete it one day.

Vector Cad Framework for .Net (using WPF)

NetVec Cad is a Cad Framework in .Net based on Windows Presentation Foundation.  The purpose of this framework is to provide vector cad functionality in .Net applications.  The short name is NVcad. 

NVcad primarily consists of NVcadView, NVcadModerator, and NVcad. NVcad is the model.  NVcadModerator is like a ViewModel or Presenter, and NVcadView is the view.

NVcadView
NVcadView inherits from System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.  NVcad is used by client applications as a WPF Custom Control.
